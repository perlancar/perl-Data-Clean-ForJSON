Revision history for Data-Clean-JSON

0.09     2013-10-14 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Revert back some code.


0.08     2013-10-14 (SHARYANTO)

         - Handle JSON::{XS,PP}::Boolean objects (convert to 1/0).


0.07     2013-09-11 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Replace Data::Structure::Util's unbless() with
           Acme::Damn's damn() because the former currently fails to build on
           Windows (I'm currently trying to make Perinci::CmdLine work on
           Windows).


0.06     2013-08-07 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Now by default clean objects by unblessing them instead of turning
           them into class-name strings.

         - No longer log cleanser code by default. You need to enable
           using LOG_CLEANSER_CODE.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add command: unbless.
